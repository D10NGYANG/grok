.P
.SH NAME
grk_decompress \- 
This program reads in a JPEG 2000 image and converts it to another 
image type. It is part of the Grok library.
.SP
Valid input image extensions are
.B .j2k, .jp2, .j2c
.SP
Valid output image extensions are
.B .bmp, .pgm, .pgx, .png, .pnm, .ppm, .raw, .tga, .tif, .tiff \fR.

.TP
.B \-\^i "name"
(jpeg2000 input file name)
.TP
.B \-\^l "n"
n is the maximum number of quality layers to decode. See LAYERS below)

.B \-\^o "name"
(output file name with extension)
.TP
.B \-\^r "n"
(n is the highest resolution level to be discarded. See REDUCTION below)
.TP
.B \-\^x "name"
(use name as index file and fill it)
.TP
.B \-\^ImgDir "directory_name"
(directory containing input files)

.B -TP R
Partition a tile into tile parts of different resolution levels
.P
.SH REDUCTION
Set the number of highest resolution levels to be discarded.
The image resolution is effectively divided by 2 to the power of the number of discarded levels. The reduce factor is limited by the smallest total number of decomposition levels among tiles.
.SH TILES
Set the maximum number of quality layers to decode. If there are less quality layers than the specified number, all the quality layers are decoded.
